# My Continuous Learning & Study Plan

I’m always eager to learn and improve my skills in software development, leveraging my background in web hosting (from my current job) and my major in Computer Science. Below is a snapshot of my study roadmap, resources, and projects—both ongoing and future plans.

---

## 1. Overview

I’m focusing on **PHP**, **backend development**, **software design and architecture**, and **web security**. I’ve had academic exposure to C++, Java, and Python but am currently honing my PHP and JavaScript skills. My goal is to build, refactor, and iterate on personal projects, integrating **AI** where possible.

- **Looking for:** A mentor, pair programming partner, and collaboration on open-source or personal projects.
- **Ultimate Objective:** Grow into a well-rounded software developer with solid backend expertise.

## 5. Goals & Next Steps

1. **Solidify Backend Skills**: Achieve deeper proficiency in PHP and continue exploring Docker, CI/CD, and API design.  
2. **Pair Programming & Mentorship**: Actively seeking a mentor or partner to exchange knowledge, review code, and tackle larger projects together.  
3. **Documentation & Reflection**: After each project, write a retrospective on challenges, successes, and lessons learned.
