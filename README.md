# My Continuous Learning & Study Plan

I’m always eager to learn and improve my skills in software development, leveraging my background in web hosting (from my work experience) and my major in Computer Science. Below is a snapshot of my study roadmap, resources, and projects—both ongoing and future plans.

---

## 1. Overview

I’m focusing on MERN stack **(MongoDB, Express.js, React, y Node.js)**, "Astro.js (content-driven website)", **software design and architecture**. I’ve had academic exposure to C++, Java, and Python but am currently honing my Website development skills. My goal is to build, refactor, iterate on personal projects, and integrating **AI**. 

- **Looking for:** A Job, a mentor, pair programming partner, and collaboration on open-source or personal projects.
- **Ultimate Objective:** Grow into a well-rounded software developer with solid problem solving expertise.
